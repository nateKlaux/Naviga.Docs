## Manage Digital Subscriptions

You can manage a subscriber's online access from the **digital** tab. From this tab, you can:

- edit a subscriber's digital registration
- add or remove another user to a subscriber's digital subscription
- view a subscriber's digital entitlements

### Navigation

### Invite a user to share registration

To invite a user to share registration:

1. Select the **invite** button next to any user in the **registrations** grid. A window appears that indicates the amount of remaining registered users. If the user has remaining invites, continue to the next step. Otherwise, you cannot proceed.
2. Add the new users first name, last name, and email address. Select either `owner` or `guest` as the user type. This determines the amount of privilege the user will have.
3. (Optionally, if `owner` is chosen, confirm the disclaimer to the subscriber and check the disclaimer box.)
4. Select the **send invite** button. An email will be sent to the specified email address and the record will appear in the **pending invites** grid. 

> (!TIP)
> Use the **add another person to invite** and **remove the last person added** buttons to send multiple invites at once!

To re-invite a user whom has not accepted their invitation:
