## Vacation Transfer

This feature allows you to temporarily change a print subscription's delivery address.

Transfers cannot overlap with other stops. You can edit or cancel existing transfers in the **scheduled stops/starts** grid.

### Navigation

You can find this feature under the **stop tab**. To navigate here, perform a [subscription search](www.subsearch.com), and then select the **stop** tab.

### Helpful Information

Here are some helpful pointers when creating or updating vacation transfers.

- Transfers must comply with the **vacation cut-off times** table.
    > For example, `Sun for Mon | 07:00 PM Sun` translates to `For a Monday transfer, the cutoff must occur by 7:00 PM Sunday`.
- If the temporary delivery address is within a delivery route, a carrier will deliver the subscription per usual. Otherwise, the subscription will ship via mail and may lead to a later delivery.
- This [workflow](example.com) can help determine how and when to process vacation transfers.
