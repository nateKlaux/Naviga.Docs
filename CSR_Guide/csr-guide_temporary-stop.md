## Temporary Stop

This feature allows you to pause a print delivery. It functions as a temporary hold of a subscription.

Temporary stops cannot overlap with other stops or transfers. You can edit or cancel existing temporary stops in the **scheduled stops/starts** grid. 

### Navigation

You can find this feature under the **stop tab**. To navigate here, perform a [subscription search](www.subsearch.com), and then select the **stop** tab.

### Helpful Information

Here are some helpful pointers when creating or updating temporary stops.

- Temporary stops must comply with the **vacation cut-off times** table.
For example:
    > `Sun for Mon | 07:00 PM Sun` translates to `For a Monday stop, the cutoff must occur by 7:00 PM Sunday`.
- **Reason**, **hold**, and **donation options** come in real-time from a circulation database.
- Some common **hold options** are `VacPack`, `credit`, and `donation`. `VacPack` refers to a vacation package where the subscription will be delivered after the vacation. Sometimes `donation` allows the subscriber to specify *where* a donation goes. `Credit` extends the subscription's expiry date in accordance with the number of paused days.
