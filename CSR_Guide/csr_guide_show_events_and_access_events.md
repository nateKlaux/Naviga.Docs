## Show Events and Access Events

This guide explores the **show events** and **show access events** buttons of the Subscription Search feature.

### Show events

Select the **show events** button to display a history of events. Each tab will display different results. For example, selecting the button from the  **account information** tab will display different events than selecting the button from the **complaints** tab.

In the search results, select the details icon to view detailed information about an event. Navigate between the tabs to view related information. **Note**: It is expected that some fields will not populate since each field does not necessarily pertain to every event type.
