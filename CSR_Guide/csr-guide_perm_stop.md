### Reference

When creating a permanent stop, you will work through the **stop saver** workflow with the subscriber. **Stop saver** includes three steps (`1. Benefit Section`, `2. Smart Offer`, `3. Stop Subscription`). These steps help curb a stopped subscription. **Note**: If the reason for a permanent stop is because of a `deceased` subscriber, the **stop saver** feature will not appear.

Notes to Self for this section:
- does a permanent stop appear in the **scheduled start/stops**?
- How configurable is **reason** list? If they're not configurable, perhaps a `reason glossary` would be helpful.
- How configurable is `2. smart offer`?

### Permanently stop a subscription

To permanently stop a subscription:

1. Select the **permanent stop** button.
2. Choose a cancellation **reason** from the drop-down list. _Reasons are configurable_?
3. Read the **benefits section** to the subscriber. If the subscriber agrees to the suggested solution, select **helpful: yes** and stop this procedure. Otherwise, select **helpful: no** and continue to the next step.
4. Present the offer(s) to the subscriber. If the subscriber agrees to an offer, select **helpful: yes** and stop this procedure. Otherwise, select **helpful: no** and continue to the next step.
5. Read the displayed message to the subscriber and choose when to stop the subscription. If scheduling for a future date, select a date.
6. Confirm the disclaimer text to the subscriber and select **submit**. You will see the scheduled stop in the **scheduled stops/starts** grid. **Note**: if the stop is immediate, it will be non-editable.
