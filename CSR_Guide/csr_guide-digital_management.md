You can manage a subscriber's digital subscription from the **digital** tab. From this tab, you can:

- view a subscriber's digital entitlements

### Share digital subscription access

To invite someone to the share digital subscription access:

1. Select the **invite** button next to any user in the **registrations** grid. A window appears that indicates the amount of remaining registered users. If the user has remaining invites, continue to the next step. Otherwise, you cannot proceed.
2. Add the new users first name, last name, and email address. Select either `owner` or `guest` as the user type. This determines the amount of privilege the user will have.
3. (Optionally, if `owner` is chosen, confirm the disclaimer to the subscriber and check the disclaimer box.)
4. Select the **send invite** button. An email will be sent to the specified email address and the record will appear in the **pending invites** grid.
