## Manage Digital Subscriptions

You can manage a subscriber's digital product **digital** tab. From this tab, you can:

- edit a subscriber's digital registration
- add or remove another user to a subscriber's digital subscription
- view a subscriber's digital entitlements

### Navigation

To view the **digital** tab, perform a [subscription search](www.example.com), and then select the **digital** tab.

### Invite a user

To invite a new user to the registration:

1. Select the **invite** button next to any user in the **registrations** grid. A window appears that indicates the amount of remaining registered users. If the user has remain registrations, continue to the next step. Otherwise, you cannot proceed.
2. Add the new users first name, last name, and email address. Select either `owner` or `guest` as the user type. This determines the amount of privilege the user will have.
3. (Optionally, if `owner` is chosen, confirm the disclaimer to the subscriber and check the disclaimer box.)
4. Select the **send invite** button. An email will be sent to the specified email address and the record will appear in the **pending invites** grid. This request is processed in real-time with the circulation system.

> (!TIP)
> Use the **add another person to invite** and **remove the last person added** buttons to send multiple invites at once!

To re-invite a user whom has not accepted their invitation:

1. Select the **invite** button next to any user in the **registrations** grid. The **pending invitations** grid will appear.

### Edit a user

To edit a user registration information:

1. Select the **edit** button that corresponds with the user in the **registrations** grid.
2. Toggle whether both the email address and password should be changed. If keeping current, select `keep current` and do nothing. If changing, select `set to...` and add the new password or email.
3. Select the **update** button next to either the new password or email. The change is processed in real-time with the circulation system.

To remove a user from the registration:

1. Select the **invite** button next to any user in the **registrations** grid.
