## Record and Process Delivery Issues

The **add new delivery error** feature allows you to process subscriber complaints. It displays product information and a redelivery window. The displayed information integrates in real-time with the client's circulation system.

(SCREEN W/ ANNOTATIONS OF REDELIVERY WINDOW AND SOLUTION)

This feature is highly configurable and clients define their own rules.
This [workflow](example.com) is a supplement to this guide and can help determine when to record and process complaints.

### Helpful Information

Here are some helpful pointers for recording and processing complaints.

- Subscribers cannot make complaints before the redelivery window on the same day. They can inside or after the redelivery window.
- Subscriber's cannot make complaints during vacation days.

### Record a complaint

To record a complaint:

1. Select the **calendar icon** and choose a complaint date.
The client determines the number of days back, as well as the number of complaints you can select.
2. Select an **error type** that corresponds with the subscriber's complaint.
Use your best judgment to match the subscriber's issue with an error from the drop-down field.
3. Choose a **resolution** for the subscriber that corresponds to the workflow and client's rules.
To choose `Redelivery`, the complaint must *not* have been made before the redelivery window.
4. Read the disclaimer text to the subscriber and check the `Disclaimer read` box.
5. Select **save**. If successful, the record will appear in the **complaints** box.

### Subscription Complaint History

The **complaints** table at the top of the page displays a history of subscription complaints.  The table displays the following categories: `Transaction ID`, `Incident date`, `Complaint description`, `Complaint option`, `Credit value`, and `Escalated`. Any new complaints will appear here.

An escalation status of `yes` occurs when a certain number of complaints are created within a certain amount of days. Both the number of complaints and the number of days is client configurable.
