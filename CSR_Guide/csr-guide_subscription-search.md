## Subscription Search Tutorial

This tutorial will introduce you to the **Subscription Search** feature of the Subcon Admin Portal. **Subscription Search** allows you to manage subscription/subscriber information.

## Find a subscription

To find a particular subscription:

1. Select the **subscription search** button on the left side of the window.
2. Fill in the appropriate search parameters.
3. Select the **search** button.
A list of matches will display.
4. Find the desired subscription from the **search results** and select either **research** or **start call**


> [!TIP] Though including `client` in your search query can be helpful, you cannot search by it exclusively.
> Attempting to do so will return an error, and the mandatory fields will be highlighted.
> Populate at least one mandatory field in addition to `client` for a successful search.
> In general, the more detailed your search parameters, the more precise and quick your return will be.

### Research

The **research** feature displays read-only subscription information quickly, allowing you to verify the subscription you are looking for.
This feature does not start a session.

### Start Call

The **start call** feature allows you to manage subscription information.
You can process requests, update information, review events, etc.
Likely, you will find yourself using this feature in most scenarios.
By default, the feature displays the [account information](www.example.com) tab.

**Note**: Upon selecting start call, the application may prompt you to confirm the subscriberâ€™s registered email address. The registered email address is different than a subscription email address. A subscriber uses the registered email to access digital subscriptions, and may or may not be the subscription email address.

(I think I should flesh this out more. Just unsure of why )

### End Call

To end a call, select the **end call** button in the upper right corner of any tab.
**Note**: If you don't deliberately end a call (with the **end call** button), after _<X<X>>_ hours the call automatically ends.

### Create a New Account

You can create a new account by selecting the **+ add account and start call** button. View [this guide](example.com) for further information.
