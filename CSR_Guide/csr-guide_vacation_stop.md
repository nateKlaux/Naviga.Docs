## Temporary Vacation Stop

This feature allows you to pause a subscription's delivery. It functions as a temporary hold of a subscription.

### Navigation

You can find this feature under the **stop tab**. To navigate here, perform a [subscription search](www.subsearch.com), and then select the **stop** tab.

### Helpful Information

Here are some helpful pointers when creating or updating temporary stops.

- Temporary stops cannot overlap with other stops or transfers. You can edit or cancel existing temporary stops in the **scheduled stops/starts** grid. If a temporary stop has already been created, you can only edit the end date (and not the start date). To edit the start date, cancel the temporary stop, and start anew.

- Reason and donation options come in real-time from a circulation database. Donation options also include _where_ a donation goes.

- Temporary stops must comply with the **vacation cut-off times** table.
For example:
    > `Sun for Mon | 07:00 PM Sun` translates to `For a Monday stop, the cutoff must occur by 7:00 PM Sunday`.

### Create a temporary stop
