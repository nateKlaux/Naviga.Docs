### Things to Know

When creating a temporary pause, there are some things to be aware of.

- Temporary stops cannot overlap with other stops or transfers.
- Temporary stops must comply with the **vacation cut-off times** table.

A **vacation cut-off times** table example:

`Sun for Mon | 07:00 PM Sun`

translates to:

`For a Monday stop, the cutoff must occur by 7:00 PM Sunday.`
