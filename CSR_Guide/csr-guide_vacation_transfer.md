### Things to Know

When creating a vacation transfer, there are some things to be aware of.

- You can edit or cancel existing transfers in the **scheduled stops/starts** grid.
- Transfers cannot overlap with other permanent stops or temporary pauses.
- Transfers must comply with the **vacation cut-off times** table.
- If the temporary delivery address is within the delivery route, a carrier will deliver the subscription. Otherwise, the subscription will ship via mail.

> For example, `Sun for Mon | 07:00 PM Sun` translates to `For a Monday transfer, the cutoff must occur by 7:00 PM Sunday`.
