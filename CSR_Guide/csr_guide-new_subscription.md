## Create a new subscription

> [!NOTE] Account registration is not created at this step. The subscriber does this on their own via self-service or the publication's website.

**Part 1**

After selecting the **+add account and start call** button:

1. Select either `no email` or add an email with `other email`. This email address will be the selected email address. It will be recorded in the event log and a confirmation of events will be sent to it.
2. Select the publication name from the drop-down menu.
3. Select a start type. `Voluntary` displays offers associated with your sales team and `code` displays offers associated with that particular code.
4. Select the source of the subscription from the drop-down menu.
5. Select the email only offer. Filter the results with the **search** and **postal/ZIP code** fields.
6. Select **go to CSR portal**.

**Part 2** 

The order in which information is collected depends on the presentation set up in the CMS.

You will be taken to the **New Start Portal**. From this screen:

1. Enter the subscriber's address information and select **continue**. Note: Digital ZIP-only and digital subscriptions will require only a postal code.
2. Enter the subscriber's payment information and select **continue**. Payment information is not required for both complimentary and start-and-bill subscriptions.
3. Confirm the subscriber’s address and payment information then select **place your order**.

> [!Note] This procedure is a best-practice example. The order in which a subscriber's payment information is collected may change, depending on how the client has configured their CMS.
