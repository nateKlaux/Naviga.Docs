## Configure activation fees for Subscription Purchases

To configure an activation fee, you must contact your Naviga Implementation Manager. Naviga will configure a service type and fee product for a one-time, activation fee in the Subscribe database. After you have completed that, complete the following steps.

### Create a sales product

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Best practice dictates creating a single sales product for all publications. This reduces complexity, duplication, and many offer groups to navigate.

Configure an activation fee sales product in the Solicitor Concierge dashboard:

1. Select **inventory**, then **products & bundles** from the left sidebar.
2. Select the **sales** tab, select **edit** next to the corresponding sales product..
3. Select the **billing products** field. A list of billing products will appear on the right. Drag the **activation fee** product into the **billing products** field.
4. Select **save**.

### Add the sales product to an offer group

Configure the activation fee in the Solicitor Concierge dashboard.

1. Select **offer groups** from the left sidebar. Your offer groups will appear in a list to the right.
2. Select an offer group from the list, or create a new offer group. The offer will now display the activation fee.
3. Select the **price** box and set the activation fee's price.
4. Select **save**.

### Outcome

Congratulations! You've configured an activation fee. You can add this activation fee to each of your products.
