### Configure available areas

#### Goal

The goal of this guide is to show you how an **Available Area** (AA) works in SolCon. An **AA** is an area that a division can be delivered to.
SolCon comes with all of the US and Canada postal codes preconfigured, but you might want to limit or expand your delivery range to a different **AA**.

#### Before you start

Make sure you meet the following pre-requisites before starting the tutorial steps:

* Reach out to your Naviga Implementation Manager to get your SolCon application up and running

#### Manage your AAs

In this section, you will learn how to create a new **AA** and delete or edit an existing **AA**.

Create an AA:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Available Areas**. Any existing or preconfigured **AAs** will display.
2. Select the **+ New** button. The creation screen will appear.
3. Choose a name for your **AA**, then add your desired postal codes.

Add a postal code:

1. Select the circular **+** button in the **ZIP/Postal Codes** section. A search feature will appear.
2. In the following order, choose a country, state, and if applicable, county and city. You can limit your **AA** to a single postal code or an entire city or state's postal codes.
3. Add individual postal codes by either dragging or double-clicking them or add your entire search query with the **add all** button. Once a postal code has been added to your **AA**, you can explore them with the expand arrow.
4. Select the **active** box, then select **save**.

Congratulations, you've created a unique **AA**. To use this **AA**, you will need to add it to your billing product, the subject of the next section in this guide.

Delete or edit an existing **AA**:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Available Areas**. Any existing or preconfigured **AAs** will display.
2. Navigate to the desired **AA** and select the pencil icon to edit **OR** the trash can icon to delete. If editing, the creation screen will appear. If deleting, confirm your choice and select **delete**.

#### Add your new AA to your billing product

In this step, you will learn how to add your new **AA** to your existing billing product. Your billing products will have been configured by Naviga to include the preconfigured US and Canada postal codes, but you will need to manually add any new **AAs** you create.

Add an **AA** to a billing product:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Products & Bundles**. Any existing or preconfigured billing products will display.
2. Navigate to your desired billing product and select the pencil icon.
3. Select the **available areas** window to highlight it. Any **AAs** you have created will appear to the right.
4. Drag or double-click the **AA** you wish to add.
5. Select **save**.

Congratulations! You've added your newly created **AA** to your billing product. 

#### What you've learned

To review, you've learned to create or update **AAs**, which are designated deliverable postal codes, and you've learned to add the **AAs** that you've created to your billing products, which enables you to add them to an Offer Group.
