### Configure terms and conditions

#### Goal

The goal of this guide is to show you how to configure terms and conditions (T&C) text in SolCon. You can create profiles (e.g. `Print Delivery T&C` or `Digital Access T&C`) and then use them in your Offer Groups.

#### Create terms and conditions text

In this section, you will learn how to create/edit/delete a T&C text profile, as well as how to use attributes and add images.

Create a T&C text profile:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Terms & Conditions**.
2. Select the **+** button. The creation screen will appear and display a WYSIWYG text editor.
3. Choose a name for your marketing text profile, (e.g. `Print Delivery T&C`).
4. Write your desired text for the _body_ fields. Use the WYSIWYG editor to format your text.
5. Add any search tags.
6. Optionally, select **set as default** then select either **physical/digital**.
7. Select **save**.

**Attributes**

Using attributes is _highly recommended_ and will save you a lot of time. Think of attributes like placeholders for publication-specific text, like a phone number or address. When a phone number or address changes, you won't need to update every marketing text profile since you're using an attribute as a placeholder. You only need to update the attribute once in the CMS. An attribute might look like this:

```...You can cancel anytime by calling the {{PublicationPhoneNumber}}...```

Add attributes:

1. Select **+Attributes**. The tab appears to the right.
2. Drag your desired attribute into the WYSIWYG editor. Alternatively, you can simply type your attribute if you know its format and name.

Delete or edit a T&C text profile:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Terms & Conditions**. Any existing profiles will display.
2. Navigate to the desired  profile and select **edit**.
3. If editing, make your changes then select either **save** or **save as new**. If deleting, select the trash can icon.
