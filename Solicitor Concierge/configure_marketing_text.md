#### Create marketing text

In this section, you will learn how to create/edit/delete a marketing text profile, as well as how to use attributes and add images.

Create a marketing text profile:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Marketing Text**.
2. Select the **+** button. The creation screen will appear and display a series of WYSIWYG text fields.
3. Choose a name for your marketing text profile, (e.g. `Digital Only`).
4. Write your desired text for the _title_, _body_, and _price_ fields. Use the WYSIWYG editor to format your text.
5. Add an internal description, a confirmation name, and any search tags.
6. Optionally, select **set as default** then select either **physical/digital**.
7. Select **save**.

Here is an annotated image that displays a _title_, _body_, and _price_.

**Attributes**

Using attributes is _highly recommended_ and will save you a lot of time. Think of attributes like placeholders for publication-specific text, similar to a phone number or address. When a phone number or address changes, you won't need to update every marketing text profile since you're using an attribute as a placeholder. You only need to update the attribute once in the CMS. An attribute might look like this:

```Unlimited digital news at {{NewspaperName}}. Call now at {{PublicationPhoneNumber}}```

Add attributes:

1. Select **+Attributes & Images**. The tab appears to the right.
2. Select the **attributes** tab.
3. Drag your desired attribute into the WYSIWYG editor. Alternatively, you can simply type your attribute if you know its format and name.

**Images**

Add images:

1. Select **+Attributes & Images**. The tab appears to the right.
2. Select the **images** tab.
3. Double-click or drag your image into the **add image** box.

Delete or edit a marketing text profile:

1. Select the **inventory** menu in the SolCon dashboard, then choose **Marketing Text**. Any existing profiles will display.
2. Navigate to the desired marketing text profile and select **edit**.
3. If editing, make your changes then select either **save** or **save as new**. If deleting, select the trash can icon.
