## Campaign-code Subscription Purchase

A campaign-code Subscription Purchase minimizes the amount of data you need to enter. Instead of entering circulation specific data (rate code, term, length, etc.), a single campaign code is sufficient.

Configure a campaign code Subscription Purchase just as you would a regular Subscription Purchase.
