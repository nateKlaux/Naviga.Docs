# Reference tables

This article explores the Reference Tables menu in the SolCon Dashboard. The Reference Tables menu displays information about the following categories:

* Coding
* Household Levels
* Sales platforms
* Service Types
* Billing plans

## Coding

Use this section to view Multi-use (`multiuse`) and One-time-use (`onetimeuse`) codes. 

The reference table will give you the name and type of code. Multi-use codes are customer coupon codes that can be used multiple times by different customers. Use them to allow customer's access to special offers. One-time-use codes are customer coupon codes that can be used a single time to give customers access to special offers.

Select the collapsed menu icon at the end of the line to view which Offer Groups are currently using the code. You can search and filter codes with the **search** and **status** fields.

You can [create new codes](example.com) from the Offer Groups menu.
