## Find your way around SolCon UI

(ANNOTATED IMAGE)

You can access most of SolCon's functionality from the Solicitor Menu.

**Offer groups**: You can create and manage your offer groups in this section. You can customize an offer group to your liking, however, recommended practice dictates that you organize your offer groups around delivery type (selfnote: 'delivery type' isn't quite accurate here). For example, _7 Day Delivery_, _Sunday Only_, _Monday, Wednesday, Friday_, _eEdition_ and so on. You can add divisions (individual publications) to an offer group and adjust their price(s) accordingly.

Organizing your offer groups in this way minimizes complexity and duplication. Instead of managing hundreds of different publications, each with their own product and delivery type, you will manage a few groups, and customize them as needed.

**Offers**: This is a read-only section that allows you to quickly view your offers and divisions.

**Promotions**: You can create and manage your promotions here. Promotions is a legacy concept, and a promotion is a group of Offer Groups.
<!-- (Replaced promotions w/ offer groups in new release. Promotions is basically legacy concept. ) -->

**Inventory**: This is a drop-down menu that allows you to manage everything related to your inventory. Create your sales products, bundles, marketing text, and T&C. You can also set up premiums and determine delivery areas.

**Teams**: Manage your sales teams here. Create a team, manage it's members, and customize what offers each team can sell.

**Reference Tables**: This is a read-only reference section that allows you to quickly view product data.

**Admin**: Add users and manage their registration to the SolCon application here.

**Sync Features**:

Clearing your cache often resolves errors. It is important to clear your cache after you have made changes in the SolCon application.
