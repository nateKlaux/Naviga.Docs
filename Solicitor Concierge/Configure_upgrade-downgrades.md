# Configure Upgrades and Downgrades

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to help you configure product upgrades and downgrades with Naviga. To configure your upgrades and downgrades, you must:

- complete and submit the Business Rules Document
- configure Solicitor Concierge

## Before you start

Make sure you meet the following pre-requisites before starting the tutorial steps:

- Have Subscribe version 3.13.
- Have NCS Circ 2018.5 or above.

## Part 1 - Complete the Business Rules Document

### Goal

The goal of Part 1 is to introduce you to the Business Rules Document. It defines the conditions for what upgrades and downgrades are presented to a subscriber. You will need to complete the document and return it to Naviga so we can implement your business rules into our databases.

### Create your business rules

A good way to format your rules is to use the following example:

`If NewspaperID = 4 and daily rate is between $0 and $0.12 AND base productID = 400002, offerGroupID = 368 and SegmentName = SaverPlus`

This translates to the following:

If the newspaper is Milroy Area Appeal (`NewspaperID = 4`) with a rate between `$0 and $0.12` and scheduled for a 7 Day Delivery(`productID = 400002`), then offer a Sunday Only Delivery (`offerGroupID = 368`) with a segment name of `SaverPlus`.

Use the following segment as a template, and replace your information:

`If NewspaperID = {X} and daily rate is between {$x.xx and $x.xx} AND base productID = {X}, offerGroupID = {X} and SegmentName = {SaverPlus}`

> [!Tip]
> You can create as many rules as you need to cover any type of scenario. The example here expounds only on the price dimension, but you will probably want to extend your rules to cover many other scenarios.

### Outcome

Congratulations! You have created your business rules. You must create business rules for all other scenarios. After you have created your rules, return them to your Naviga Implementation Manager.
