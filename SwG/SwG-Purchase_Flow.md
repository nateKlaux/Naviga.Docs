# Subscribe with Google Purchase Flow

## Overview

This article shows you how to purchase a supscription with Subscribe with Google.

## Before you start

Make sure you meet the following pre-requisites before starting the how-to steps:

* have a Google account
* are purchasing from a website that supports Subscribe with Google

## Step-by-step guide

Navigate to the desired website and:

1. Select the **Subscribe with Google** button.
2. Login to Google (if not already logged in).
3. Enter payment information (if not already saved).

Google does the rest. Google returns the purchase and user data to Naviga, which creates a record in our database. The API makes the request _up to_ three times, if at which point it wasn't successful, the process stops. View this [workflow]() for a visual representation.
